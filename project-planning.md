## Aims and hypotheses

### Nicola

* Independent variables – grip vs non-grip; seated vs non-seated.
* Dependent variables – power at the crank, CoM movement, upper and lower body power contributions

The aim is to examine the effect of grip vs no grip in both seated and non-seated posture on power generated by the upper and lower limb and subsequent movement of the centre of mass during a 5-second maximal power (sprint) task [in recreational cyclist].

We hypothesise that there will be more power generated by both the upper and lower body during grip conditions compared to non-grip [and that this effect will be larger for the non-seated posture] and that the centre of mass will displacement will be less in the grip vs the non-grip conditions.

### Oliver

* Independent variables – grip v non-grip; seated vs non-seated

* Dependent variables – muscle EMG activity (peak, average over cycles), joint moments

The aim is to examine the effect of grip vs no grip in both seated and non-seated posture on peak and average muscle EMG activity and joint moments generated by the extensor muscles in the lower limb during a 5-second maximal power (sprint) task [in recreational cyclist]. A secondary aim is to examine the timing and amplitude of EMG of upper body muscles in the conditions.

We hypothesise that there will be an increase in EMG peak and average in the extensor muscles in the lower limb that will be related to increases in the joint moments at the lower limb joints during grip conditions [contributing to greater power with grip in both seated and non-seated cycling]. We also hypothesise that the upper body muscles will have significantly greater EMG amplitude during gripped cycling.
